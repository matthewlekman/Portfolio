I am an undergraduate software engineering student at Nottingham Trent University with a strong foundation in programming languages Python, C++, and JavaScript. 

My passion for technology drives my dedication to understanding and solving complex problems, and I thrive in environments where innovation and learning go hand in hand. Hard-working and determined, I am eager to deepen my expertise and apply my skills in real-world settings. 

My academic journey has honed my analytical abilities and introduced me to the practical aspects of software development, from creating efficient algorithms to building responsive web applications. Beyond academics, I actively explore the tech landscape to stay updated on emerging trends and tools. 

My long-term goal is to contribute meaningfully to an ambitious tech company that shares my vision for innovation. Securing a placement within such a company would provide the perfect platform to refine my technical and professional skills, preparing me for a future where I can work remotely and embrace the global opportunities this industry offers. 

With an unwavering desire to learn and grow, I am ready to face challenges head-on, collaborate effectively within teams, and make a lasting impact wherever my career takes me.
