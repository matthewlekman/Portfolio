  <h2><i>Where do I want to be?</i></h2>
  
  <body>
  I aspire to become a Software Engineer for a company that aligns itself with similar values to ones I am predisposed with. 
  To be apart of a team that contribute equally and each play to their strengths to produce the best output possible. I am particularly interested in working on 
  meaningful projects which I have a genuine passion to fulfill.
  
  A flexible working lifestyle has always appealed to me. 
  The access to culture and perspectives that remote work can offer is one of the things I desire to thrive from. 
  I am a strong believer in getting out of your comfort zone and developing as you broaden your horizons.
  
  <h2><i>What skills do I need?</i></h2>
  
  After some time researching, it seems skills do not simply boil down to what technical skills you have. 
  They branch into different types, in particular: <b>soft skills</b>. 
  Soft skills, in my eyes, are the skills that help you work with others and become the best team member that you can be.
  <br>
  Those that I believe are essential are as follows:
  </br>
  <ul>  
    <li>Perseverance</li>
    <li>Adaptability</li>
    <li>Listening</li>
    <li>Goal-oriented</li>
    <li>Driven</li>
    <li>Respect</li>
    <li>Punctual </li>
    <li>Communication</li>
  </ul>


  <br>Having said that, I believe you can never stop developing your soft skills - and every soft skill is important.</br>
  
  <br>As far as technical skills go, I think this is fairly straightforward.</br>

  <ul>  
    <li>Bachelors Degree</li>
    <li>Competent in a variety of languages </li>
    <li>Skilled with web design: HTML and CSS </li>
    <li>Familiarity with practices such as version control (Git) and knowledge of methodology</li>
    <li>Driven</li>
    <li>Respect</li>
    <li>Punctual </li>
    <li>Communication</li>
  </ul>
