<b><i>What does professional behaviour mean to me as a student?</i></b>

My definition of Professional Conduct boils down to being respectful, reliable and being a good team member. Respect for my tutors, my peers and the learning process. Reliable when attending meetings, handing in coursework on time and following through on commitments. A good team member encompasses these traits and allows me to produce the best work possible. 

<b><i>How can being unprofessional affect me and others?</i></b>

Being unprofessional doesn’t just damage my career prospects and limit my potential, but it does so for my team members and peers. They deserve the opportunity to excel in their endeavors and completely disrespecting this entitlement is an act of vice in my eyes.

<b><i>Which student behaviours will matter in my future career?</i></b>

A lot of what I do now is directly relevant to working in tech. [The BCS Code of Conduct](https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/) highlights the need for integrity, respect for privacy, and lifelong learning—all things I’ve already started building into my habits. For example, knowing how to use and store data safely is important now, but in a future IT role, it’ll be essential. And being honest in my academic work prepares me to be ethical with code and content in a professional setting.

<b><i>What do I still need to develop?</i></b>

There’s definitely more to learn. I want to get better at explaining technical stuff in ways others can understand—communication is a big part of working in tech. I also want to deepen my understanding of things like intellectual property and data protection laws, because these will be really important if I’m building or handling software for real clients. For me, professionalism isn’t just about following rules—it’s about becoming someone others can trust to do the right thing.
