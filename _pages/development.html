  Continuous Personal Development <b>(CPD)</b> is the process of actively improving your skills and knowledge during your career. 
  I believe this practise can be applied to more than just your career - but your life. CPD is a mindset.
  You should <i>always</i> be looking to improve.

<h2>üíº Part-Time Work</h2>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
  <strong>Role:</strong>Team Member at Greene King
  <strong>Date:</strong> November 2023- &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <strong>Hours Claimed:</strong> 5
</div>
<div>
  <p>
    Working part-time in a customer-facing role helped me develop soft skills like communication, teamwork, and handling pressure. I learned how to balance responsibilities, manage time effectively, and adapt to fast-paced environments.
    These soft skills directly translate to professional roles ‚Äî especially in tech teams where communication, time management, and collaboration are vital.
    I'll continue this role part-time while seeking tech internships, using this experience in future CVs and interviews to demonstrate transferable skills.

<h2>üìö Online Courses</h2>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
  <strong>Course:</strong> LinkedIn Learning &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <strong>Date:</strong> 5 March 2025 &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <strong>Hours Claimed:</strong> 5
</div>
<div>
  <p>
    I completed a course on intercultural communication, learning how to navigate and respect cultural differences in professional settings. It highlighted how values, assumptions, and communication styles vary across countries.
    This is especially relevant to working in international teams or with global clients. It supports my goal of working in a globally connected tech environment.
    I'll look for more courses on remote team collaboration or global software delivery, and apply what I learned in group projects with diverse teammates.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
  <strong>Course:</strong> C++ &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <strong>Date:</strong> 3 February 2025 &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <strong>Hours Claimed:</strong> 8
</div>
<div>
  <p>
    I completed an online course focused on the fundamentals of C++, covering variables, control structures, functions, pointers, and object-oriented programming. It helped reinforce what I had learned in class while letting me practise more independently.
    C++ is a core language in computer science, and gaining confidence with it boosts my ability to build efficient, low-level applications. It also strengthens my understanding of memory management and performance ‚Äî key concepts that set strong developers apart.
    I plan to build a small project in C++ (like a basic game or utility), explore STL (Standard Template Library), and deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming by reviewing more advanced topics like inheritance and polymorphism. I also intend to practise coding problems on platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode in C++ to apply what I‚Äôve learned.

  <p>
    I used NTU's CV builder and CV scanner tools to structure my CV and check it for relevance and keyword alignment. I received feedback from advisors to improve clarity and impact.
    A strong CV is essential for internships and placements. This activity helped me better present my technical and soft skills in a way that employers notice.
    I'll keep my CV updated with each new activity or skill and tailor it for each role I apply to. I'll also use this improved CV to apply for summer internships and remote placements.
